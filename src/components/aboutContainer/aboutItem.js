          At TechTogether Boston, we're looking to shape the way
          <span> women and non-binary people</span> get involved with tech.
        </h2>
        <p>
          We aim to create an inclusive environment to encourage more
          underrepresented people to either get introduced to the world of
          technology or harness their skills to create projects of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the support of our community, sponsors, and industry leaders, we
          can chip away at the gender gap in technology. From students with
          non-technical majors who are interested in breaking into tech, to
          seasoned hackathon veterans looking for help to build out complex,
          groundbreaking products - we aim to support our hackers.
